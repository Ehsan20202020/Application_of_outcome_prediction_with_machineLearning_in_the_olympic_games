# Application_of_outcome_prediction_with_machineLearning_in_the_olympic_games
# Objective:
This project aims to develop models using pre-game available information to predict the number of medals each country will win at the Rio Olympics. Additionally, the numbers of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals are also predicted using different machine learning models. Furthermore, it predicts the ranking or performance of the top 10 countries in the upcoming Olympics.
# Data Analysis:
I am using the Kaggle dataset as a data source to develop the project. The dataset I downloaded from Kaggle is titled "Tokyo 2020 Olympic Medals (Tokyo 2020 Olimpiyat Madalyası)" and can be found at this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/2021-olympics-medals-in-tokyo). The dataset I am using consists of 93 rows and 6 columns, with variables including Country (country names), Gold Medal (number of gold medals won), Silver (number of silver medals won), Bronze Medals (number of bronze medals won), Total (total number of medals won), and Rank By Total (team ranking).

Firstly, necessary operations were performed using the Python language, such as data cleaning and checking for any missing values, with processes like assigning values in case of missing data. Training and validation data were generated. All modeling exercises were done using the scikit-learn package in Python.

# Method and Algorihtm used for the project.
I utilized Firebase Firestore technology, which is suitable for Flutter projects. Additionally, I am using the Random Forest Regressor for model creation and prediction processes. I attempted to integrate my mobile application developed with Flutter with machine learning using the Scikit-learn library.
# Database:
As seen in Figure, the training model was added to Firestore, and then the Flutter mobile application was integrated with Firestore to access the ML model.

# Authentication:
As seen in Figure, the email address, registration date, last login date, and the unique user ID of a person who registers in the application are visible through this service. This service also facilitates operations such as email verification, email change, and password reset. Additionally, users can log in to the application using social media accounts such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Github through the authentication service.
